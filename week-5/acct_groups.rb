# Pseudocode

#In this challenge, you will make your own method to automatically create accountability groups from a list of names. You'll want to make of the People in your cohort. Try to get everyone into an accountability group of 4 or 5. Be sure everyone is in a group of at least 3 -- It's no fun if someone is in a group by themself or with one other person.
# Input: List of names
# Steps:
# create a variable and set equal to the list of names
# create a container to hold a list of strings
# split the string by a separator(,) into arrays of groups of 4 or 5
# Output: Accountability groups as arrays

# What was the most interesting and most difficult part of this challenge?

# The most difficult part for me was passing the data appropriately. After reviewing my unsuccessful code, I found that I had uncessessary lines of code and was calling the wrong elements.

# Do you feel you are improving in your ability to write pseudocode and break the problem down?

# Somewhat. I think I left frustration and anxiety get in the way this week so I didn't take time to really think through the pseudocode to have a more successful intial solution.

# Was your approach for automating this task a good solution? What could have made it even better?

# I think it was a good solution. I could have tried some more of the complexity tasks, but didn't due to time constraints.

# What data structure did you decide to store the accountability groups in and why?

# I went with arrays this time arround because it seemed like the most logical and simplest approach.

# What did you learn in the process of refactoring your initial solution? Did you learn any new Ruby methods?

# I used methods that I had researched previously for this approach. I learned that there are many approaches that could be taken within the same data structures. Utilizing the different methods can change how the data is returned when using arrays.
