# 0. Pseudocode

# What is the input?
# Positive Integer
# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?)

# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?
=begin
1. WHILE integer index is greater than or equal to -3 no comma is needed
2. ELSE comma is added to integer with index divisible by -3

# 1. Initial Solution
def separate_comma (integer)
  if integer.length 99999<=>10000
      return Commas

end
