Open Source
  • Open source software is publicly available source code. The source code is able to be customized as individuals see fit.
  • As a programming beginner, the idea of open source seems very positive. I think it would allow for continued review/practice as I continue to learn.
Licenses
  • Licenses that allow the public the participate in the editing and adding to source code seem to have benefits for both those who have licensed and those who find interest in the code. It’s important for those licensing to fully understand the end result they are looking for when deciding how to make the source code public. I think the more eyes and brainpower source code attracts the fast process improvements can be made.

It was helpful for me to complete the commit and push process again for this challenge. I will still need to review these steps a few more times in the coming weeks to ensure I completely understand the process/what needs to take place. I think focusing on what needs to happen is the main goal throughout the process and memorizing the commands throughout the process.

I had a quick review of choosealicense.com for an overview of license definitions in addition to the resources provided in the challenge.
