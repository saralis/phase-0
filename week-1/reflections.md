###1.1 Think About Time Reflection
I focused on Flow/The Zone for techniques and identifying triggers to help me get in that focused and satisfied state of mind. Though I’ve heard this before, it was a great reminder to limit distractions as best possible (easier said than done sometimes working remotely). Also, allowing time for reflection is a technique that I would like to implement more effectively. Time Boxing is setting a time limit on when a task should be completed. If the task runs over the determined time, rather than working until the task is completed, you stop at the limit to review the work that has been completed. Based on review, additional time limits are determined to complete the task. Given Phase 0 is remote, I plan to use this strategy to help manage the program challenges as well as my full time job and my personal time. I think this can be utilized to encourage efficient productivity throughout the week. I recently started working remotely for my current employer and have found it challenging to stick with designated work hours and completely disconnect in the evenings. I think the flow and time boxing techniques will help me to designate work time and personal time more effectively and concretely. Overall, I plan to have daily DBC hours blocked to allow me to work on challenges bit by bit and review/reflect at least once a day.

###1.2 The Command Line Reflection
The shell is a program that allows you to interact with the operating system via commands. Bash is a shell/command processor. For the most part, this challenge was straightforward. The most challenging part for me was dealing with about 3 or 4 commands where I felt like some definitions/explanations where missing in the Crash Course (ex: copying a file from one directory to another). I needed to do additional research to complete a few of the tasks. I was able to complete all commands except for grep. This I found the most challenging as I didn’t see any response in the terminal after typing in the first command and did not entirely understand the directions. The most important commands/arguments I think are those that allow you to find and search through large amounts of directories, files and their contents. This includes find/DIR –R, wildcard matching, and cat. Command definitions below:
-pwd     prints the working directory/folder
-ls         lists what is in the directory/folder
-mv      moves/renames files
-cd        allows you to navigate identified directories
-../        moves up the tree/path
-touch   creates empty files
-mkdir   creates directory
-less      allows you to view contents of a txt file
-rmdir    removes a directory
-rm        removes a file
-help      use to find information about a command

###1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection
Create a New Repository
- Log into GitHub
- Click the “+” at the top right of your screen
- Click the New repository option
- On the Create a new repository complete the Repository name, select if the repository will be Public or Private, then finally click green Create repository link at the bottom of the web page.

Fork a Repository
- Create a copy of an interesting repository by clicking another user’s repository (ensure your username is visible before the repository name) then select the Fork icon to the right of the screen.
- You may receive a prompt to ask where the repository should be forked to if you belong to different GitHub organizations. If so, click on the GitHub with your username
- Once the repository has successfully been forked, GitHub will redirect you to your copy of the repository. You should see your ‘username/repository name’

Clone a Repository
- Open your terminal and confirm where you are (type pwd). Ensure you are in the correct directory
- You will have to get the URL of your forked repository. The URL can be found to the right of the repository page next to either SSH or HTTPS (If HTTPS, be aware you may have to log into your GitHub account again.
- Copy the URL then include in the command below in the terminal:
git clone URL_THAT_YOU_COPIED

Forking a repository vs creating a new one is beneficial as you are able to continue coding on work that others have already had input on. You have the ability to build on a foundation vs starting from scratch. I installed Git and created a GitHub account several weeks ago, but don’t recall any issues with that process. I did, however, learn about the difference between the two.
