Reflection
***

**What is a one-to-one database?**
***

A one to one database occurs when two tables can be associated with each other based on only one matching row. Primary and foreign key contraints are used to connect them.

**When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).**
***

One to one is useful when you have details at are important to a table but may not necessary be required to review constantly. The one to one allows for the additional details to be accessed when needed.

**What is a many-to-many database?**
***

In a many-to-many relationship, one or more rows in a table can be related to  multiple rows in another table.

**When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).**
***

You would use this when the elements you are looking at have multiple relationships that tie them together. If they can be linked in many different ways.

**What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?**
***

The idea of linking schemas makes sense. It's understanding when the senarios should be used that is a bit confusing.
