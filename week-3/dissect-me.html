        <p>Have you ever worked on a project or wrote a paper and at some point something went wrong? Either information was deleted by accident, you had a change of heart on the wording or approach used previously and wished you could go back to how it used to be. Wouldn’t it be great if you could rewind? This is where Version control would be mighty handy!</p>

        <p>In terms of coding, version control keeps track of edits. It allows you to see when changes were made, why they were made and what content actually changed.</p>

        <p>Let’s now take a look at Git and GitHub - Git is a version control system utilized locally (on your computer) when installed on your Command Line Interface. GitHub utilizes the Git version control system remotely/on the internet. Both allow for multiple edits simultaneously and merges the changes once committed* so that there is one main document being worked on at all times. GitHub requires uploads from the work being done locally on your computer and tracks the edits made but multiple individuals. GitHub helps with Version control when collaborating. Multiple individuals can work on the same material at the same time and, once uploaded, GitHub merges the edits into the one version being worked on.</p>

        <p>As you continue to learn and practice code, remember that version control is your friend. There for your to make things a little easier!</p>

        <p>*A commit is done to save your work when comfortable with the progress. Commit allows you to save bundles of changes at a time as you move along the work/project.</p>

<!-- What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

* Html - to specify the language the browser is meant to interpret
* Head - for metadata including title and links to stylesheets among other elements
* Title- for the title of the site tab
* Body - for the content of the web page
* H1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 - hierarchy of headers


How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

Elements are laid out like a tree with cascading branches. Browsers begin to display elements by the hierarchy in which they are layed out starting with the the language to be rendered (html) then by header (includes metadata) followed by the body (main, footer and other applicable tags).


What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I learned that Sublime provides utility outsite of just writing and saving code. It allows files to multiple files to link and speak with one another to lessen the burden of redundant code. It's a time saver if used correctly.
