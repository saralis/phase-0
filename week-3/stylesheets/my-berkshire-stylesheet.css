*/What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?

It is important to inclue the correct elements when linking an external file to an HTML file. To link a stylesheet (ex below), you MUST include the link type to specify that we are dealing with css, the relationship to recognize the stylesheet, and the href to link the actual css file.

<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="css url"/>


What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?

I felt that I started off well with my positioning, but once viewing the html file in chrome, elements were not landing the way I had expected. As I went through and finished the challenge, I thought about other options I could have used to achieve the position I had intended.


What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)

I used the hexadecimal to modify color, and float/margin for positioning. I also used pixals for font-size.


Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you choose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?

I utilized classes to help me designate the text to adjust font size, positioning for only particular sections.


When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?

The source code had cleaner html format. I tried to stick with the best practices throught, but with trying different methods and techniques the format got away from me a bit.
