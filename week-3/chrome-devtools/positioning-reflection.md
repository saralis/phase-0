**How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?**

Chrome's DevTools allows you too adjust fomatting and positioning in CSS with immediate review of the page. You'll be able to tell instantly if these elements are positioned as intended.


**How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning?**

Elements can be resized on the DOM via height and width in CSS.

Absolute positioning is in relation to the first parent element it has that doesn't have position:static. If there's no such element, the element with position: absolute gets positioned relative to <html>.

Fixed positioning anchors (or "glues") an element to the browser window.

Static positioning is the default positing if a positioning type is not specified. The element will be placed where it would normally go.

Relative positioning tells the element to move relative to where it would have landed if it just had the default static positioning.


**What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?**

The margin is the space around the element. The larger the margin, the more space between our element and the elements around it.

The border is the edge of the element.

The padding is the spacing between the content and the border.


**What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)**

This challenge was overall, straightforward. I enjoyed playing around with the senarios to replicate the examples given and it was easy to navigate and drive with my pair. I also enjoyed doing the research when stuck. I lead to great conversation with my pair as we tried to make sense of what we were doing.
