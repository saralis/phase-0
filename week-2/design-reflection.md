What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

My site's primary goal will be to brand myself, shows examples of my abilities, and highlight my interests. I intend to include projects (current and archives). I'd also like to post about my interests (ex: photography) perhaps in the projects or blog portion.

What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

The main thing someone should know about design and user experience is that they are very much related but not the same thing. Though the design process takes audience and user experience into consideration it also focuses on client objective and aesthetics. UX focuses on how users utilize and perceive the interface.

User experience design strives to provide value, ease in use, and an overall pleasant interaction for users when interfacing with a site/system. Given the amount of web users globally, ux design is valuable because it focuses on providing as positive an experience for targeted audiences. This focus hopefully keeps audiences interested and returning.
