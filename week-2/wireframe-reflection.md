**What is a wireframe?**

*A wireframe is a blueprint or guide that allows you to layout and plan for how users will see and interact with the interface.*


**What are the benefits of wireframing?**

*Wireframing allows you to start brainstorming, drafting and planning ahead before dealing with code. It provides the opportunity to think through how information is presented and how a user would navigate through the interface.*

**Did you enjoy wireframing your site?**

*I did enjoy wireframing. I was excited to think about layout and content of my site and also excited thinking about how I will be building this out in the next couple weeks. It was actually relaxing looking through some of the wireframing tools and playing around with layouts.*


**Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?**

*I made a few changes from my original idea. When looking at the layouts and thinking about content, I found myself asking "does this make sense here?" a few times and made some additional edits if the answer was "No."*

**What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?**

*I did wonder about format constraints for this future site that would impact these layout designs. I believe this will best be answered as we continue on with the assignments and build out the site. I also wondered about the best tool(s) to utilize for creating wireframes. After clicking on links to suggested tools, it seems it really just comes down to preference.

**Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?**

*I enjoyed the planning and drafting during this task. Reviewing the wireframing tools to see differences and finding the best one at this time to utilize was probably the most tedious task for this challenge.*
