<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was great! It's very exciting to see immediate results of your work and it felt even better to build out the site with elements I've memorized and when I was stuck I was able to work with my pair pretty easily to track down the answer.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
I am still learning about the many semantic elements, but I found using them in sublime was pretty easy given the auto fill.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
I kept in mind the purpose of HTML understanding it is a markup language. I tried to keep in mind that I should be looking at the header/content in terms of hierarchy vs how it looks. Also, I made sure to use the validator while recreating the site content to ensure there were no issues with the html used.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
Although there is a lot of elements to HTML that I still need to explore, the good thing about it is the basics seem intuitive. Moving along what I've learned so far makes sense. The bad for me right now maybe how I can get lot in the text as more and more content is added. I think this may be getting used to the visual aspect of code as I move along.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
I have gone back to the videos and resources provided in previous challenges as well as research more on HTML5. The only trick I have found helpful at the moment is just review and refresh. I takes me a few times of watching/reading/reviewing to really absorb new information.
